![Different stages of blog](/meme/midwit-memes.jpg)

You all have always wondered, what would be the best way to write blogs, and we all have went through all three stages.

## Stage 1 (Just started)

First, you will find yourself just starting with whatever you know and try to implement more things later on, one after another.

## Stage 2 (Technology Hell)

Then you will get to stage where you want to implement everything, like a <mark>CMS</mark>, <mark>Authentication</mark>, and even a <mark>Payment provider</mark>, like what not (Yeah, that was me ðŸ˜…)

## Stage 3 (Self Actualization)

Then I thought, let's settle onto basic things, then start, then I found some really great templates which I wanted to create my own variant and use it for myself, which took endless hours to set up, fixing their outdated code, modifying, and at last, ending up in just a mess or me leaving it.

But now, I just want to do stuff, so now, I have settled into just using a premade template, modify the bare-minimum (my personal details) and **THAT'S IT**

## Future

I used to be in tech field for a very long time, but now I have decided to embrace both of my skillsets, i.e. my knowledge tech and my background in <mark>Commerce</mark>

Here, I would publish my financial knowlege ðŸ“Š and some tips to learn tech and commerce concepts better!
