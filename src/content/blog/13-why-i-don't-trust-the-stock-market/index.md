## Introduction

Many fin-fluencers these days are telling everyone that they should invest their money into the stock market to get themselves an easy retirement, and they should start as early as possible, and _I'm not buying THIS_ and here's why.

## The need to invest in the first place

Remember, back in the days, our parents used to just save their money for their retirement and that was more than enough, and it's applicable, even now as well in some cases, but even back then there wasn't any formal jobs and most of our ancestors did farming and poultry. But back then the inflation did existed, but it was not as bad as it is now! (Remember to keep a note on the inflation part), so now we can't just put our money in savings and think we can retire comfortably (we can, but it would just a little uneasy but its definitely 100% possible)

## Why stock market and not other options?

That's where the neat part comes, it doesn't have to be stock market at all, infact our predecessors have been investing in land, education, gold for a very long time and just by investing in these things, even in today's world, would give you more than enough corpous to retire comfortably, but THEY don't want that; and now who are THEY?

By THEY means the big corporations!!!

See, we know that the resouces are limited in this world and stocks, since they are not are not a physical resource like currency, can be printed, and reselled infinitely!

Now that's where the big game begins, cuz now by printing these virtual assets, they big corporations are creating enormous wealth and buying all the PHYSICAL ASSETS...

and leaving investors with a piece of virtual paper, that has no physical value.

And that's where the old saying goes:

**_You will own nothing and you would still be happy_**


Now, these corporations can't forcibly sell you stuff to get rich, like say for example one phone costs around 20k inr, so how many phones can you possibly buy in a lifetime 10? 20? 30?, and this equates to around 4,00,000-6,00,000 inr in lifetime sales from one person by the entire industry (not a company, but a whole ass mobile industry), so companies now squeze more money from the people, so they bought up these things called as SHARES, that makes you feel like you own a part of a company legally, but in actual, you own NOTHING, it's the directors and founders who actually own the company, directors having more weight here...

Now people won't directly buy stuff like SHARES which involves actual money, so they started a new thing called fin-fluencers to help them buy their shares (mind you, some fin-fluencers are also blinded by these corpos)

They paid govt to help them make it a legal thing, to benefit themselves, cuz _people with money are the people in power_ and this eventually made it a general norm these days.

And since they can't fool old people, they are trying to prey on young people who are in college and just started their carrers.


This eventually led to inflation, cuz now everyone is money hungry, which increased the price of goods, and with these increased, it has now become a necessity to invest our money, atleast somewhere.

## So what should one do?

The thing, that will benefit you the most is getting **REAL PHYSICAL ASSETS**, which in future will give you periodical income (small or less, even or uneven, it doesn't matter), which can actually give you freedom, and not just papers worth millions, but when torn gets reduced to ZERO. I won't be giving you any suggestions, otherwise, there won't be difference between them and myself, so go research youself, cuz it's YOUR MOONEY!!


## Conclusion

Rememeber, it't YOUR HARDEARNED MONEY, don't put it somewhere by listeing to some BS influencer, or to some sh!tcoin, cuz if you do, you are the GREATER FOOL HERE...
