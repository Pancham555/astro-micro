## Introduction
We all have used chatgpt to search for things, find some basic stuff, some simple talking.. but have you ever used it to it's full potential? In this blog, I am going to show you how to prepare notes using chatgpt / gemini to create notes...

## Step 1: Gathering data
First, we will gather data using chatgpt...
Here we will be using previous year questions as reference to find our notes..
so first ask chatgpt to find question papers for previous years (say for example previous 5 years) and find the answers to those questions in accordance to the marks alloted to it in the paper. Make sure to to add _(write full answers and not just points)_ in your prompt, as chatgpt or any other chat model usually gives answers in points only

## Step 2: Arranging data
Now ask chatgpt to arrange the questions in a neat format alongwith, the questions with the year in which it was asked and the marks alloted to it altogether before the answers. By doing this, it will arrange the document in a neat and clean format.

## Step 3: Create PDF
Usually after doing all this, chatgpt automatically asks if you want to create all this in a pdf. If it asks you the say _yes_, else ask it to create a pdf for you which will contain all this information in a neat and clean format.

And there you have it üéâ!

This is how you use chatgpt to create notes you üìù

And BTW, if you're a lazy ass and didn't read all this, then take this prompt and modify it based on your needs

2. _Now write all questions, alongwith the marks alloted to it and the year in which it was asked with their answers written below_ (do required modifications whenever necessary)
