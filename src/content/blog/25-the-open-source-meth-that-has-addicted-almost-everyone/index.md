## Introduction

We are often told and hyped about the open source tools but we often don't realise to value things that actually matter, which is saving costs, like why do we write efficient code, do stuff efficiently in general... To save costs only!

And sometimes open source tools are not **ALWAYS** the right way for it, lemme tell you why!

## Why Open Source sometimes sucks ðŸ˜ ðŸ’¢

The problem about open source tools mainly is that it's TOO MUCH OVERHYPED

Yeah, that's it!

Open source tools are also made with the same languages, with same technology many times, are also hosted in the same servers as well, the problem is that the things who CLAIMS to be open source and host their services, need to keep their tools running, for which they need to make a PROFIT to keep them sustaining, which in turn adds up to the cost!

Like if you're a big company, nothing matters, you have the capital needed, you can do anything you want! but for a indie developer, it's sometimes not sustainable

## Why Closed Source, sometimes works better

If you use propritory tools like google's firebase, chatgpt models, which are not open-sourced, you're paying a cost to maintain themselves and earn them a SUPER NORMAL PROFIT (A finance term, go search yourself), but Sometimes, they might give out free tiers, and other benefits to bring customers, that too without adding a card, which is best of testing and creating small projects.
In case of open sourced ones, that is very minimal, almost negligible in today's standards. 
So just for building small projects and testing, closed sourced ones are a great for it, also they are more generous if you ask them to increase their free/testing limit, cuz you're now investing your time and energy into their closed source thing, which, in the long run, could give me great profits form your business.


## Conclusion

Do what your budget, not what the twitter/X says. It's your money, use it wisely, by making informed decisions, and not getting into a hype train!
