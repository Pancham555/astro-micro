## My personal comments
See, we have to agree that every government, in the hopes of making more employment/ getting more money for themselves/ for their party/ making someone else benefit, whatever the rearon is; it is now getting into a really ugly face, and the damage is already been done, and probably can't be reversed, what can we do as an indivisual? should we accept it and go with the flow?
**HELL NO**

THIS IS SOMETHING I'M GONNA DO, NOT NECESSARILY YOU SHOULD DO AS WELL, THIS IS ONE OF MANY WAYS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE YOURS ON YOUR OWN!!!

After my graduation, (which would take another 2 years), I would try my best to go to any jobs I could possibly find, and you should do it too, as this is the only best way to figure out what to do in your life, then I would focus on getting up the corporate ladder (I know i doesn't sound exiting and often not intimidating but let me continue). It doesn't have to take your entire life to get up and became a CEO or CTO or CFO, you just have to go to the point where the growth becomes a very tough job, after that try working less and less in the job (just enough to not get fired üòÜ) then work on some side hustles, mostly a business that doesn't require that much time, effort and energy like renting houses, starting an airbnb hotel, investing in gold (not stocks), things that might require a good chunck of capital but not that much time so that you give your time to your job and your family. Do this over and over, and you would have accumulated enough wealth to not work and still be having a big corpus of money coming to your bank account every single month, without having to work ever again. Remember this won't make you a millionare but it would give you freedom to do anything in your life, just with some certain monetary limitation, the limitation being the amount entering into your bank account every single month. Also to achieve this, it might also take several years of your life as well, depending on the amount of salary you get from your primary job every single month, which is why I told you to climb up the corporate ladder just enough tat get you a decent salary to work on this sh!t, and if necessary, go upskill yourself, get more degrees, diplomas whatever you need to achieve this.

Hope this helps you in your career and your future!
